					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with loops.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had trouble understanding loops since we weren't able to attend class on Wednesday due to traveling for the holiday and despite using our resources we still found the concepts confusing. We plan to resubmit as soon as we clarify our confusion.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It's good to ask for help when it's needed especially in situations like this! However, just to be able to submit this lab on time, we were thankfully able to reference our professor's github example page. We will resubmit once we have a better understanding of loops and can complete this lab to its full potential.</p>
