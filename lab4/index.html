			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create pseudocode and turn it into JavaScript comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main issue we had was inputting our detailed lists onto this page as it was very time consuming. Knowing how to properly indent was one issue that came up for us, but we ended up indenting how we saw fit. We also figured out how to add subtasks to our ordered lists by finding resources online.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was an interesting introduction to pseudocoding as it's something I've never done before. It sounded like it would be more difficult than it was.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Burning an etch into copper using Ferric Acid for Intaglio Printing:</h2>
					<p><i>Collect Materials: drawing, copper plate, hard ground solution, sponge brush, simple green, nitrile gloves, eye protection, apron, contact paper, packing tape, pencil, etching tool, baking soda, tub
					</i></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Acquire clean, polished copper plate</li>
						<li>De-grease copper plate</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Use simple green cleaning solution</li>
							<li>Remove with cold tap water</li>
							<li>Proceed to next step only once plate has dried</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Apply Hard Ground solution to plate with sponge brush</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Apply a thin layer with straight lines</li>
							<li>Proceed to next step only once hard ground is dry and becomes matte</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Use graphite pencil to draw image directly onto dry hard ground</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Cannot press too hard without risk of damaging hard ground</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Use etching tool to scrape away hard ground where the drawn lines are</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Etching tool should follow path of graphite lines</li>
							<li>Etching tool should not be pressed too hard, otherwise copper will be damaged</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Clean surface of plate with hard ground to remove flakes</li>
						<li>Aquire contact paper with dimensions of plate to place on raw side</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Contact paper should only be placed on side of plate with no hard ground to protect raw copper</li>
							<li>If paper is too large, cut away to make fit perfect</li>
							<li>If paper is too small, do not use</li>
						</ul>
						<li>On top of contact paper, place a long strip of packing tape, with sticky side facing in/against contact paper</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Do not let tape stick to any other surface</li>
							<li>If tape sticks to any other surface, replace</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Prepare to encounter acid</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Use eye protection, apron, and nitrile gloves to prevent acid contact with eyes/skin</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Bring plate to acid bath</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Plate should be slowly dipped into acid bath without splashing</li>
							<li>Use remaining length of tape to stick to outer lip of acid bath container to secure it</li>
							<li>Do not let plate fall in, it is impossible to fish plate out of acid bath</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Leave plate in bath for 45 minutes, leave the room during this time</li>
						<li>Remove the plate only after 45 minutes, repeat step 10a before re-engaging with acid</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Only touch tape that has not been in contact with acid when removing</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Place plate into tub with cold tap water,  3 tbsp of baking soda, leave in for 30 seconds</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Water may fizzle and turn brown, do not remove before 30 second mark</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Rinse plate off with cold tap water, cold tap water neutralizes acid</li>
						<li>Allow plate to air dry fully</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Only engage with plate without protective gear once it has air dried fully</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Remove contact paper and tape one air dried fully</li>
						<li>Plate is now ready for printing press</li>

				<h2>Creating a virtual Cup Pong game:</h2>
				<ol>
