    // Display each player’s cups on screen
    // Ask each player to toss their ping pong balls
  // If one ball makes it into a cup:
      // Remove the cup
    // Ask the next player for their move
  // If both balls makes it into two cups:
      // The current player gets two more ping pong balls
      // Repeat process until all cups are gone
  // If the ball misses a cup:
    //  Begin next player’s turn
  // Else:
    // If all cups are gone, supply players with one extra cup and ball to begin bonus rounds
    // End with one winner
