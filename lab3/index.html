			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload our work to be available online through GitHub.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the issues I faced was resizing my images since I had accidentally deleted the "px" which got confusing. Mostly, it was understanding which screenshots to submit, as it wasn't totally clear at first. But, we figured it out!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was helpful working with a partner to bounce questions off each other and finish our lab! Coding was straightforward and the images in the Lab 3 description were useful.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We added selfies, an unordered list of linked labs, and completed this page with our summaries.</p>
