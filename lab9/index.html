					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with buttons using jQuery. (and boy, was it a challenge...)</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was the most difficult we've done together as it was really tricky for us to figure out how to get our buttons to work. After asking for help on Discord and finding this
					<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-important#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20ways%20you,selector%20with%20a%20higher%20specificity.">article on HubSpot</a>, I was able to stop
					my <i>.special</i> and <i>.highlight</i> CSS from being overridden in order to finally get my buttons functioning properly.</p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was very challenging for us in figuring out how to get the click function to work, but it takes a lot of determination and research in order to get back onÂ  the right track. I feel like I truly learned the most from this lab since it was the one I struggled with more than any of the others so far.</p>

					<p>Here is my index.html. Click the buttons to activate their functions!</p>
